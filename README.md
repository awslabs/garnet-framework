Garnet is an open-source framework for building scalable, reliable and interoperable platforms leveraging open standards, FIWARE open source technology and AWS Cloud services.

It supports the development and integration of smart and efficient solutions across multiple domains such as Smart Cities, Regions and Campuses, Energy and Utilities, Agriculture, Smart Building, Automotive and Manufacturing.

Garnet facilitates the creation and connection of smart solutions. It provides you, off-the-shelf, geospatial and subscriptions capabilities, datalake, device management and digital twin capabilities. It helps you avoid vendor lock-in and break silos. It makes it easier to build knowledge graphs, bring data together into one single space from heterogeneous sources, both internal and external, and extract actionable insights from your data.

Using Garnet, you can easily integrate existing solutions and add new capabilities and modules over time.

There are only three types of components in a platform and solutions built using Garnet: Data Producers, Data Consumers and Garnet as the core platform.

Garnet is the core component of your platform. It all starts with it.
