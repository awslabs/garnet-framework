### Overview

The Garnet Framework is an open-source framework that enables you to build living digital twins and context-aware solutions through dynamic knowledge graphs. 

By creating unified, continuously updating digital representations of your physical environments and processes, Garnet Framework delivers the contextual intelligence that powers smart decision-making across domains including Smart Cities, Energy, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Agriculture, Buildings, and Transportation.

Garnet Framework is built on the [NGSI-LD](https://ngsi-ld.org/) open standard and leverages the open-source FIWARE Context Broker technology. It is designed to be easily deployable on the AWS infrastructure using the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (CDK), allowing for streamlined deployment and management. 

Through its knowledge graph capabilities, Garnet transforms fragmented data into interconnected knowledge that evolves in near real-time with your operationsâ€”providing the essential context your applications and AI systems need.
